# quiz-game

Excited to share my latest project! I've developed a fun and engaging States Guessing Quiz using Python, Pandas, and a user-friendly GUI. The game utilizes CSV files to store state data, tracks player progress by recording the number of correct guesses, and even generates a CSV file at the end listing the states that were missed. This project allowed me to solidify my skills in data manipulation, GUI development, and file handling.
